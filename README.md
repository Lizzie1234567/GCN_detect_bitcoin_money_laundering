# GCN_detect_bitcoin_money_laundering
### This project attempts to use new techniques in the field of AML applied to the bitcoin blockchain.
In this project we have the following goals:

1. Achieve higher meaning representation of the transactions of the Elliptic blockchain dataset. Produce a transaction tracker that creates graphs making it possible to inspect viasually the performance of the classifier 
2. Reproduce the techniques proposed in the paper hoping to achieve comparable results. 
3. Work on some new state of the art convoluted networks and compare it to the original 
4. Attempt the making of an attention layer in the GCN (GAT) and compare the results with the original paper.
